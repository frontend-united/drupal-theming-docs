Contributing to the Guide
=========================

If you have any additions or updates to the book, please just fork this repository on GitHub and create a pull request. If you are looking for more information on a subject, open an issue in the queue, and our developers will see if it is an appropriate topic for this guide.

Note that currently, this is a guide primarily devoted to Drupal 7 theming, but most of the tools can be used with any installation of Drupal. Once Drupal 8 becomes more stable, we will add more Drupal 8-specific guides and practices.

There is documentation on how to edit GitBooks in [their own documentation](http://help.gitbook.io/). There is also an [awesome application](http://help.gitbook.io/editor/README.html) that you can download to easily edit the book locally. We highly recommend you use it to edit any part of the book, or add new information.
