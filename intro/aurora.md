# Aurora

The [Aurora Base Theme](https://drupal.org/project/aurora) is built to have all of the HTML5 template files you need, some needed preprocess functions, and absolutely nothing else. It is a base theme for those who are used to making completely custom themes. It is minimalist, and intended to give themers as few opinions on how their site should be made as possible. It was originally created by [Snugug](https://twitter.com/snugug) and is not maintained by [iamcarrico](https://twitter.com/iamcarrico).
