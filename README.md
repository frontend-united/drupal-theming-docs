Guide to Drupal Theming
=======================

Drupal theming has changed dramatically over the years. As technology has changed and updated, we have realized that we needed more tools in our toolbox to create a truly amazing web. Thus, we present our completely open source documentation on Drupal theming, mixing together the knowledge of many to give you a helpful starting guide for Drupal theming.


## Where we began

The maintainers of [Zen](https://drupal.org/project/zen), [Omega 4](https://drupal.org/project/omega), [Aurora](https://drupal.org/project/aurora) and [Mothership](https://drupal.org/project/mothership) all realized that we were working concurrently on similar work. This was not taking advantage of the power of open source, so we wanted to collaborate together to ensure a more complete front end Drupal guide. This originally started with the development of the [Magic Module](https://drupal.org/project/magic), to hold similar frontend code in a single contributed module.

## What you will find here

This guide is meant to be a starting place for Drupal themers. It will go over what has become standard theming practices, tools, modules and processes that much of the Drupal community has adopted. This is not to say that this is the only way to theme a Drupal site (see *101 Ways to Theme a Drupal Site*). But we do want to help create some standardizations within our theming practices, so that we can work together as a community to make some awesome tools for us all to enjoy.

## What about \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_?

__Contribute!__ Open Source software works best when we have all of us come together to share ideas and information together. If you find errors, or want to bring more ideas to the book, just open a pull request on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/frontend-united/drupal-theming-docs) and we would be happy to make this guide more complete.

## Why isn't this on Drupal.org?

There are many reasons why this guide is being published here, and not on Drupal.org. Mainly though, we want a place where we can all contribute together, and a git repository is a great place to do that. Pages on Drupal.org have the downside that only one person can edit a section at a time, and it is harder to do versioning on. Certainly, once this guide is more complete, we will link to this GitBook from Drupal.org and have the most information available.
