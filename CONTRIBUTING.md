Contributing to the Guide
=========================

If you have any additions or updates to the book, please just fork this repository on GitHub and create a pull request. If you are looking for more information on a subject, open an issue in the queue, and our developers will see if it is an appropriate topic for this guide.

Note that currently, this is a guide primarily devoted to Drupal 7 theming, but most of the tools can be used with any installation of Drupal. Once Drupal 8 becomes more stable, we will add more Drupal 8-specific guides and practices.
